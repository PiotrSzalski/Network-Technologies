### **Model**</br>
Simulation which estimate the reliability of the network model. First task count only probability of not decomposing, second task count intensity in network and maximum packets delay.
### **Framing**</br>
Implementation of framing algorithm according to the principle of "pushing bits" and uses CRC sums. First program create frames and second interpret them and check correctness based on CRC.
### **CSMA/CD**</br>
